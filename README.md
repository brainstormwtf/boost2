# BOOST

BOOST is a crypto-native crowdfunding app designed to boost your project on the TON blockchain.

## Description

BOOST allows users to create and support crowdfunding campaigns in a decentralized manner, leveraging the power of the TON blockchain and Telegram's ecosystem.

## Origin Story

BOOST was initiated at the Berlin TON Hackathon, born from the idea of creating a seamless and decentralized crowdfunding platform for the TON community.

## Current Features

- ✅ Telegram Mini App integration
- ✅ Fetches Telegram Username

## Work in Progress (WIP)

- Dedicated Escrow Smart Contract (on testnet initially) for each project
  - During active time, projects can be boosted by the community
  - At project end:
